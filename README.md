# Features

- **Standalone client**

   Legcord is built as a standalone client and doesn't rely on the original Discord client in any way.

- **Various mods built-in**

   Enjoy [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord), [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord), [Shelter](https://github.com/uwu/shelter) and their many features, or have a more vanilla experience, it's your choice!

- **Themes**

   Legcord natively supports theming of the entire app, you can easily import BetterDiscord themes and manage them

- **Made for Privacyâ„¢**

   Legcord automatically blocks all of Discord's trackers; even without any client mods, you can feel safe and secure!

- **Supports Rich Presence**

   Unlike other clients, Legcord supports rich presence (game activity) out of the box thanks to [arRPC](https://arrpc.openasar.dev).

- **Mobile support**

   Legcord has **experimental** mobile support for phones running Linux such as the PinePhone. While this is still far from an ideal solution, we're slowly trying to improve it.

- **Much more stable**

   Legcord is using a newer build of Electron than the stock Discord app. This means you can have a much more stable and secure experience, along with slightly better performance.

- **Cross-platform support!**

   Legcord was originally created for AArch64 Linux devices since Discord doesn't support them. We soon decided to support every platform that [Electron supports](https://github.com/electron/electron#platform-support)!

You can easily enable transparency effects and adopt Windows' Fluent Design, offering a modern and sleek interface. Though it's fundamentally a web wrapper, we have implemented numerous optimizations and patches to ensure a smooth and tailored experience for you.
